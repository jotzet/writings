# How to get around Tricity?
So you're probably planning your trip to Tricity and trying to understand the system of moving around this area but find it really unclear?
Or you already got here and wanted to use public transport but instead of traveling through **Gdańsk, Sopot, and Gdynia**, you've managed to visit... stress, chaos, and confusion? We've all been there. The system of getting around here can be confusing at first, but this guide will help you to sort that all out! You will surely find that it is not as difficult as it seems.
## Trains
This is basically the best option if you meet at least one of the following conditions:
1. You're traveling long distances
1. You need to move between cities
1. You like trains

There are a few railroad carriers you could consider, but you should be focusing mainly on [SKM](https://www.skm.pkp.pl/) and [Polregio](https://polregio.pl/pl/), as they offer the best network of connections in the entire Tricity. Mind that **they do not have their website available in English**, which could be a barrier, but we'll get to that later.

If you're going further afield, you might consider using carriers like [InterCity](https://www.intercity.pl/en/). However, if you're not going anywhere outside Tricity, it's best to avoid them, as they make far fewer stops within the area. If you do decide to use InterCity, be aware that they only stop at major stations, so plan accordingly.

## Buses and trolleys
You will probably use them most of the time, because of their dense network of connections. They are controlled by two companies: [ZTM Gdańsk](https://ztm.gda.pl/) and [ZKM Gdynia](https://zkmgdynia.pl/). As the names suggest, the first one is operating in Gdańsk, and the second one is in Gdynia. 

In **Gdansk**, you can find the day buses (numbered from 100 to 600) and the night buses (marked with the "N" letter and a number). Keep in mind that **night buses, unlike the day buses, do not stop at every station unless you click the "stop" button before**. Also, remember that night buses are sometimes your only option to travel during nighttime. 
In **Gdynia**, apart from the day buses (or trolleys) and the night buses, you will also encounter express buses (marked with letters only, for example: "J" or "K").

You may be wondering, what about **Sopot**? Well, both the ZTM Gdańsk and ZKM Gdynia operate in the city, which may be quite confusing, because sometimes they require a different ticket, but don't worry about that yet. For now, keep in mind that the way to differentiate them is very simple - look at their color. Are they red and beige? It's ZTM Gdańsk. Are they blue and white? It's ZKM Gdynia. That's it!

## Trams
Gdańsk is a highly touristic city, which means that sometimes you will have to face traffic jams on its streets. However, it is not a problem at all if you travel by tram! They are the best option during rush hours and there are currently 11 tram lines in Gdańsk, controlled by the ZTM Gdańsk company. Unfortunately, you can't find them in Sopot or Gdynia. 


# Planning your route
There are plenty of ways you could plan your route. Let's list a few of them:
1. [Google Maps]("https://www.google.com/maps"). If you've missed it, they have the option to check the public transportation and it works really great.
2. [jakdojade.pl]("https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.citynav.jakdojade.pl.android&hl=en") mobile app. This option is probably the best as you can also buy your tickets there, but we'll get to that.
3. Bus stop/Train station plans. Most of them are quite clear and include a map that allows you to visualize your route.
4. Ask the commuters! There is a proverb in Polish that translates to "Those who ask questions never lose their way". However, it's better to use this option only if the previous failed.

# Tickets
It's finally the time to talk tickets. There are many places where you can buy single tickets:
1. In some special [ticket sales points](https://mzkzg.org/punkty-sprzedazy-biletow-jednorazowych-24-i-72-godzinnych)
2. Ticket machines
3. From the driver/engineman
4. Mobile apps

This is where it gets a bit tricky. First of all, ticket sales points are not always open. Even if they are, it's not always guaranteed the seller speaks English. Some tickets need to be validated before entering a bus/train, some do not. Ticket machines are not available at every station and sometimes they break. You cannot buy tickets on every bus. In fact, you cannot do that on most of them. In trains, you have to enter the right (first) wagon and it's much more expensive if you've entered the train on a station with a ticket selling machine. There are separate tickets for trains and buses/trams. Sounds complicated? Well, it is. Rumors say that someday the companies will take care of this mess. 

Until then, **it is very much recommended to buy tickets from mobile apps.** Most of them are available in English, they allow you to buy both seasonal and single tickets, they don't need to be validated at all, and... they are cheaper in most cases. You read it right. It really makes a little sense to not buy the tickets this way. Examples of apps you can use:

- [jakdojade.pl]("https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.citynav.jakdojade.pl.android&hl=en")
- [zbiletem.pl]("https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=zbiletem.zbiletem&hl=en")
- [mPay]("https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.mpay.app&hl=en")

So, remember to use mobile apps. If you can't or don't feel like using them, try the ticket sales points or ticket machines. Don't be afraid to ask for help if you need it! Most of the Tricity inhabitants are really helpful. **If you have a physical ticket, you should always check whether it should be validated or not.** You can validate your ticket on a bus/tram, but the tickets for the trains need to be validated at the train station.

Also remember that train tickets are valid for three hours from purchase/validation, and tram/bus tickets are usually valid for 75 minutes. Information about how long the ticket is valid is always on the ticket/in your mobile app.


# Your alternatives
If you can't find your way to your destination or public transportation is not an option, don't worry, there are still other ways to get around Tricity.

## Taxi and carsharing apps
Taking a taxi can be pricey, but there are a few apps that offer fair discounts. You might want to consider installing all of them and compare prices to make sure you're getting the best deal:
- [Uber](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ubercab&hl=en&gl=US)
- [FREENOW](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=taxi.android.client&hl=en&gl=US)
- [Bolt](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ee.mtakso.client&hl=en&gl=US)

Carsharing is another option worth considering. In Tricity, you can choose between two companies: [PANEK]("https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.panekcs.mobile&hl=en&gl=US") and [Traficar]("https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.express.traficar&hl=pl"). Just rent a car through your app, drive to your destination, and leave it wherever it's allowed. 
## Electric scooters
It is getting really popular around the world and Tricity is no exception. The apps that offer you to rent the scooters in Tricity include:
- [TIER]("https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tier.app&hl=en&gl=US")
- [Lime]("https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.limebike&hl=en&gl=US")
- [Dott]("https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ridedott.rider&hl=en_US")
- [FREENOW](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=taxi.android.client&hl=en&gl=US)
- [Bolt](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ee.mtakso.client&hl=en&gl=US)

Just keep in mind that you should ride on the bicycle paths and not park your scooter in the middle of the sidewalk. It's not allowed, and it can be annoying for the locals.

# Conclusions
Hopefully, you know the basics of getting around Tricity now. Here's a little cheat sheet for you:
1. Plan your route using **Google Maps** or **jakdojade.pl** mobile app.
2. Go to your station.
3. Buy the tickets by one of the apps: **jakdojade**, **zbiletem.pl**, **mPay**, or using the ticket machine/ticket selling point.
4. Validate your ticket if needed (inside the bus/tram or at the train station)
5. Enjoy your trip.

 If it still seems a bit complicated, it's fine. The more practice you have, the easier it's going to become. So, don't let the potential complexities of public transport put you off exploring Tricity. With a little bit of planning and some willingness to ask questions, you can easily get around this beautiful area and see all it has to offer.
